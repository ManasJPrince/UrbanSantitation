# Urban Sanitation Intelligence Platform 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Unified

### Hosted Project Link
[http://localhost:5173/]

### Project Description
The Urban Sanitation Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive smart city solution designed to modernize waste management. It integrates real-time incident reporting, sanitation worker task management, and data-driven analytics into a unified dashboard to ensure cleaner urban environments.

### The Problem statement
Rapid urbanization has led to inefficient waste collection, resulting in overflowing bins, delayed pickups, and environmental health hazards. Traditional methods lack real-time monitoring and accountability.

### The Solution
We provide a centralized platform that connects citizens, sanitation workers, and improved municipal administration. By leveraging IoT-enabled smart bins (simulated/planned) and a responsive web application, we enable real-time tracking of waste levels and efficient task allocation.

## Implementation

### For Software:

#### Installation

**Backend:**
```bash
cd urban-sanitation-platform/backend
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd urban-sanitation-platform/frontend
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### Run

**Backend:**
```bash
cd urban-sanitation-platform/backend
# Run the FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
*Backend runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000*

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd urban-sanitation-platform/frontend
# Run the development server
npm run dev
```
*Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173*

### For Hardware:

#### Components Required
[List specific hardware components here, e.g., Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04, Servo Motors]

#### Circuit Setup
[Explain connections, e.g., Connect Trig pin to Arduino D9, Echo to D10]
